			<h1>About</h1>
		<br>
		<div class="line-break"></div>
		<br>
		<p>I am an enthusiastic, motivated, hard worker with a passion for technology. 
		I’m currently studying a BSc (Hons) Degree in Information Technology Management in ITT Dublin 
		where I hope to learn and build my future as a technology professional. 
		I’m looking now for an opportunity to develop my experience and technical career. 
		I have experience with customer support and a good technical base with
		hardware and software.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I am a proven high bar performer, with a passion for technology, the customer and delivering results.
		I'm a fast and bright learner, able to take in large amounts of information and process it quickly while getting to grasps with new issues easily. 
		I work great in teams as I have a positive can-do attitude and I'm highly analytical, with excellent communication and problem solving skills. 
		I'm able to complete tasks with great attention to detail, within deadlines. 
		I have a great desire to learn new things and to perform to best ability in all endeavours.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I’m an avid swimmer, having swam competitively over my life time and playing water polo at a top level.
		I’m very involved with charity work having worked in Zambia raising much needed funds for education. 
		I also enjoy cooking and socialising and in addition I have a keen interest in technology.</p>

		<br>
		<h4>January 2017-August 2017</h4>
		<h4>Managed Services Intern, Typetec Ltd.</h4>
		<br>
		<p>A technical, customer facing, problem solving role translating technical customer problems into solutions.
			Analysing and resolving technical issues through contact channels directly and indirectly 
			Quality assurance and troubleshooting complex problems to resolution through virtual machines
			Successfully delivering end-to-end Project goals e.g. delivering a new RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management) Platform across Typetec’s entire customer base.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4>June 2016-August 2016</h4>
		<h4>Technical Support Intern, XSellco Software Limited</h4>
		<br>
		<p>This was a very fast paced role that required quick and professional responses to customers in order to achieve customer satisfaction. 
		I learned how to think on my feet in order to resolve unusual customer queries, multitask, and work well within the Support Team to deliver under pressure and to think independently.
		A team orientated cross functional role with an analytical approach to problem solving
		This role required an in-depth understanding of XSellco’s software products and handling customer queries through contact channels.
